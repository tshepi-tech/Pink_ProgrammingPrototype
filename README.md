# Website prototyping for Pink Programming

Pink Programming is a Swedish NGO exploring to update their website. The staff at Pink Programming are not developers and require a no-code solution to navigate their website, because of this Wordpress remains the platform for the website to be built.

Technical recommendations we provided on best practises for the website they envision to have within the limitations of Wordpress. 

In two instances, I developed a custom widget for them to use. 

1. To have a responsive layout. When position elements outside of Wordpress column structure, content does not respond well. To overcome this and ensure minimal technical "trial and error" , a wideget was created. This was beneficial because the layout of the widget would be useful in multiple sections of the website. 

2. The client would like to replace the plugin of the current calendar used on their website. A custom widegt was created to have a calendar with only the information necessary for the client and fitting for the design of the possible new website.
